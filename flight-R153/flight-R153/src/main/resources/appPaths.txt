There are five major views in FLIGHT:

1. MAP (default view)
2. LIST
3. TRENDS
4. BAR
5. PIE

usually a view has its own distinct components, there are however some components that are shared across all views:
the DASHBOARD, which includes an UPPER section to specify search parameters
and a LOWER section, which displays sector information.
There is also a FACILITY SUMMARY PANEL, which can hidden in the left-hand side of all FLIGHT views.
